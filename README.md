Lightweight utility to display the progress of your process as a pretty table in the command line.

* Alternative to TQDM whenever you want to track metrics produced by your process
* Designed to monitor ML experiments, but works for any metrics-producing process
* Allows you to see at a glance what's going on with your process
* Increases readability and simplifies your command line logging

## Quick start code

```python
import random
import time

from progress_table import ProgressTable

# Create table object:
table = ProgressTable(num_decimal_places=1)

# You can (optionally) define the columns at the beginning
table.add_column("x", color="bold red")

for step in range(10):
    x = random.randint(0, 200)

    # You can add entries in a compact way
    table["x"] = x

    # Or you can use the update method
    table.update("x", value=x, weight=1.0)

    # Display the progress bar by wrapping an iterator or an integer
    for _ in table(10):  # -> Equivalent to `table(range(10))`
        # Set and get values from the table
        table["y"] = random.randint(0, 200)
        table["x-y"] = table["x"] - table["y"]
        table.update("average x-y", value=table["x-y"], weight=1.0, aggregate="mean")
        time.sleep(0.1)

    # Go to the next row when you're ready
    table.next_row()

# Close the table when it's finished
table.close()

## Troubleshooting

### Exceesive output

Progress Table works correctly in most consoles, but there are some exceptions:

* Some cloud logging consoles (e.g. kubernetes) don't support `\r` properly. You can still use ProgressTable, but with `interactive=0` option. This mode will not display progress bars.

* Some consoles like 'PyCharm Python Console' or 'IDLE' don't support cursor movement. You can still use ProgressTable, but with `interactive=1` option. In this mode, you can display only a single progress bar.

> By default `interactive=2`. You can change the default 'interactive' with an argument when creating the table object or by setting 'PTABLE_INTERACTIVE' environment variable, e.g. `PTABLE_INTERACTIVE=1`.

### Other problems

If you encounter different messy outputs or other unexpected behavior: please create an issue!

## Installation

Install Progress Table easily with pip:

```
pip install progress-table
```

## Alternatives

* Progress bars: great for tracking progress, but they don't provide ways to display data in clear and compact way
    * `tqdm`
    * `rich.progress`
    * `keras.utils.Progbar`

* Libraries displaying data: great for presenting tabular data, but they lack the progress tracking aspect
    * `rich.table`
    * `tabulate`
    * `texttable`
